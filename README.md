# SDG-Indicator-1171

This repository contains the scripts that the Columbia Climate School [Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)](http://www.ciesin.org) used to compute United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 11.7.1 with global open data. [SDG 11](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11) aims to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.” Prevalence of and access to public space is critical for achieving SDG 11. Aside from [environmental benefits, public space can also help improve public health, bolster community, and encourage economic exchange](https://unhabitat.org/programme/global-public-space-programme). As one measure of progress, the UN has established [SDG Indicator 11.7.1](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=11&Target=): “Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities.” 

Using open data, CIESIN computed SDG Indicator 11.7.1 results for 8,873 urban centers across 180 countries. Urban center extents and identifying names from the European Commission's Joint Research Center’s [Urban Center Database (UCDB)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ucdb2018Overview.php) were used for the production of this data set. 

This work was completed in support of the [Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](https://earthobservations.org/index.php) [Human Planet Initiative (HPI)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/HPI.php). CIESIN plans to update the SDG Indicator 11.7.1: Urban Public Space - Availability and Access data set annually to help countries track their progress towards SDG 11 and to facilitate international comparisons.
